    Dollars Raised for Saint Adalbert's School in 2019
</div>

<h5><br><br>Thank you to our parent's, alumni, and all others who helped us smash our goal of raising $9,000 at the 2019 Fisher Regatta!<br><br></h5>
<h5>Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we were unable to have the 2020 Fisher Regatta; however, we were still able to raise several thousand dollars through other events and donations.</h5>
<h5>We now hope to make the 2021 Regatta our best ever, targeting $25,000, more than double our 2019 goal.<br></h5>

<h2>Fisher Regatta</h2>
<p>
    The Fisher Regatta is known as the largest, most successful, and most outrageous signature event on campus. The regatta is a one-on-one boat-racing tournament on St. Mary’s Lake, and each boat entered must be home-made. Most dorms field at least one boat, and other non-dorm boats compete as well. Past years have seen everything from giant pirate ships to floundering Styrofoam rafts to floating basketball courts. 
    Last year’s regatta saw two new boats for Fisher Hall: a speedy plywood canoe and a giant party-barge. The Regatta draws over a thousand participants and spectators, and free hamburgers, brats, and hot dogs are available all day. Ranked as one of ESPN’s Top 100 college events, the Regatta is one of the biggest reasons why Fisher is known as the Cadillac of Dorms. YA GOTTA REGATTA!!!
    <br> <br>
    Of course, we forgot to mention the infamous Regatta Hawk, a legendary tradition known across campus, where Fishermen all shave their hair into mohawks to promote dorm unity and the spirit of the Fisher Regatta.
